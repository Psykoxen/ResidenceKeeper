# ResidenceKeeper

ResidenceKeeper is a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework. It aims to simplify the management of finances and tasks within a shared residence, whether it's a shared apartment, a co-owned house, or any other type of cohabitation. This application is designed to be a centralized tool that helps occupants efficiently and transparently manage their daily lives.

## Key Features

- **Shared Calendar**: Keep track of important dates and events, such as bill due dates, cleaning schedules, and social gatherings.

- **Expense Reports**: Generate detailed expense reports to analyze spending patterns and ensure fairness in financial contributions.

- **User Profiles**: Each resident can create a profile with their contact information, financial preferences, and task preferences.
